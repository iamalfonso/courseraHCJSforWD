				<p>Earth, otherwise known as the world, (Greek: Γαῖα Gaia; Latin: Terra) is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its axis over 365 times, thus an Earth year is about 365.26 days long.</p>
